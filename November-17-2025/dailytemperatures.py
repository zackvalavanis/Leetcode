# Hint
# Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

# Example 1:

# Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
# Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

from typing import List
temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]

def monotonic(temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]: 
  n = len(temperatures)
  ans = [0] * n
  stack = []

  for i, temp in enumerate(temperatures): 
    while stack and temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
      prev_index = stack.pop()
      ans[prev_index] = i - prev_index
    stack.append(i)
  return ans
  
print(monotonic(temperatures))
