# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
# You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending order. It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:

# [3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
# [1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.
# Notice that rotating the array 4 times moves the last four elements of the array to the beginning. Rotating the array 6 times produces the original array.

# Assuming all elements in the rotated sorted array nums are unique, return the minimum element of this array.

# A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?

# Example 1:

from typing import List
nums = [3,4,5,6,1,2]

def min_rotated(nums: List[int]) -> int: 
  left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
  res = nums[0]

  while left <= right: 
    if nums[left] < nums[right]: 
      res = min(res, nums[left])
      break
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    res = min(res, nums[mid])

    if nums[mid] >= nums[left]: 
      left = mid + 1
    else: 
      right = mid - 1
  return res

  

  return minimum  

print(min_rotated(nums))
