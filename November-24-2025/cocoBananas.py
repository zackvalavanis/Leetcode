# Koko Eating Bananas
# You are given an integer array piles where piles[i] is the number of bananas in the ith pile. You are also given an integer h, which represents the number of hours you have to eat all the bananas.

# You may decide your bananas-per-hour eating rate of k. Each hour, you may choose a pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, you may finish eating the pile but you can not eat from another pile in the same hour.

# Return the minimum integer k such that you can eat all the bananas within h hours.

# Example 1:

# Input: piles = [1,4,3,2], h = 9

# Output: 2

import math
from typing import List

piles = [1,4,3,2]
h = 9

def coco_b(piles: List[int], h: int) -> int: 
  left, right = 1, max(piles)
  best = right


  while left <= right: 
    k = (left + right) // 2
    hours = 0

    for pile in piles:
      hours += math.ceil(pile / k)
    if hours <= h: 
      best = k
      right = k - 1
    else: 
      left = k + 1
  return best
