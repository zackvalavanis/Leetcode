# There are n cars traveling to the same destination on a one-lane highway.

# You are given two arrays of integers position and speed, both of length n.

# position[i] is the position of the ith car (in miles)
# speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour)
# The destination is at position target miles.

# A car can not pass another car ahead of it. It can only catch up to another car and then drive at the same speed as the car ahead of it.

# A car fleet is a non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. A single car is also considered a car fleet.

# If a car catches up to a car fleet the moment the fleet reaches the destination, then the car is considered to be part of the fleet.

# Return the number of different car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

# Example 1:

# Input: target = 10, position = [1,4], speed = [3,2]

# Output: 1

# Pickup on this tomorrow..
