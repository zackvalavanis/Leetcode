# Hint
# Given a string s of lower and upper case English letters.

# A good string is a string which doesn't have two adjacent characters s[i] and s[i + 1] where:

# 0 <= i <= s.length - 2
# s[i] is a lower-case letter and s[i + 1] is the same letter but in upper-case or vice-versa.
# To make the string good, you can choose two adjacent characters that make the string bad and remove them. You can keep doing this until the string becomes good.

# Return the string after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be unique under the given constraints.

# Notice that an empty string is also good.

 
# Example 1:

# Input: s = "leEeetcode"

s = "leEeetcode"

def makeStringGreat(s: str) -> str: 
  stack = []

  for char in s: 
    if stack and (ord(stack[-1]) - ord(char)) == 32: 
      stack.pop()
    else: 
      stack.append(char)
  return "".join(stack)

print(makeStringGreat(s))
