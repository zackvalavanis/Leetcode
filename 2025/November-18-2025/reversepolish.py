# Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
# Solved 
# You are given an array of strings tokens that represents a valid arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

# Return the integer that represents the evaluation of the expression.

# The operands may be integers or the results of other operations.
# The operators include '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
# Assume that division between integers always truncates toward zero.
# Example 1:

# Input: tokens = ["1","2","+","3","*","4","-"]

# Output: 5

# Explanation: ((1 + 2) * 3) - 4 = 5

from typing import List

tokens = ["1","2","+","3","*","4","-"]
