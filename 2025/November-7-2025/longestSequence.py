# Longest Consecutive Sequence
# Solved 
# Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.

# A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element. The elements do not have to be consecutive in the original array.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,20,4,10,3,4,5]


nums = [2,20,4,10,3,4,5]

def longestSequence(nums: List[int]) -> int:
  number_set = set(nums)
  longest = 0
  for num in nums: 
    if num - 1 not in number_set:
      length = 1
      while num + length in number_set: 
        length += 1
      longest = max(longest, length)
  return longest


print(longestSequence(nums))
